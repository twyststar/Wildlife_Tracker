    <h3>The Forest Service is considering a proposal from a timber company to clear-cut in the Leimalama Wilderness Area.</h3>
    <h4> Before they give the go-ahead, we need to do an environmental impact study.</h4>
    <h4>We've created this page so that the public that visits the area can join our rangers in reporting wildlife sightings.</h4>
    <p>Our mission is to provide the most accurate information possible, and in doing so ensure responsible stewardship of our wild places.</p>
    <p>To help in this mission, we have divided the area into several regions. You can learn more about the specific regions by following the link on the right.</p>
    <p>On the left you will find a link to our animals page, where we keep records of all our known resident species.</p>
    <h3>To view all sightings, or report a new one, visit the <%= link_to "sightings", new_sighting_path %> page!.</h3>
